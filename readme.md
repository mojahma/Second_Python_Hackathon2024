-    Find a suitable API to use
     ``` API_KEY = '<OPENWEATHERMAP><YOUR_API_KEY>' ```

# API Integration Process

The integration of the OpenWeatherMap API involved the following steps:

-    Obtaining an API key by signing up for a free account on the OpenWeatherMap website.
-    Making HTTP requests to the OpenWeatherMap API endpoints to fetch weather data.
-    Parsing the JSON responses from the API to extract relevant weather information.
-    Displaying the weather data on the application's frontend using HTML templates.
